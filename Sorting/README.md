# Sorting Algorithms

## Selection Sort Algorithm
**Selection Sort** is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm that works by dividing the input list into two parts: the sorted part and the unsorted part.

The algorithm repeatedly finds the minimum (or maximum, depending on the sorting order) element from the unsorted part and swaps it with the first element of the unsorted part. This process is repeated until the entire list becomes sorted.
